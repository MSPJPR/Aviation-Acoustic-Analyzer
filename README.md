The Aviation Acoustic Analyzer is a web-based application that simulates and visualizes key acoustic phenomena related to aviation. The goal is to provide an interactive platform for understanding and analyzing the various noise sources, effects, and behaviors of sound in the context of aviation acoustics.

Key Features:

1. Doppler Effect Simulation:

This feature allows users to simulate the Doppler effect by adjusting the speed and frequency of sound waves. It visualizes how sound waves propagate with changes in the relative velocity of the source and observer. The user can interact with sliders to modify speed (in meters per second) and frequency (in Hertz), with a real-time graphical representation of the wave propagation.



2. Aircraft Noise Simulation:

This section focuses on simulating noise levels for different aircraft engines, such as propellers, pistons, turbo engines, fans, and exhaust jets. Users can simulate the noise output of various engines and receive a calculated noise level in decibels (dB). This feature helps in understanding the noise characteristics associated with different aircraft components.




Technologies Used:

HTML: To structure the content of the website, including headers, sections, and user interfaces.

CSS: For styling and responsive design, ensuring the application looks good across different devices.

JavaScript: To handle the logic for Doppler effect simulation, noise level simulation, and dynamic interactivity.


Benefits:

Real-time Interaction: Users can adjust parameters like speed, frequency, and engine type to simulate different acoustic phenomena.

Educational Tool: Aimed at helping students, researchers, and enthusiasts learn more about the principles of sound and acoustics in aviation.

Noise Prediction: Provides insights into aircraft noise, which is an essential aspect of aviation engineering, especially when considering environmental impact, design, and regulatory requirements.
